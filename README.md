This is a basic TodoList apllication built on `SpringBoot 3.2.0`(A Maven Project), which has functionality of `Spring Security`. `BootStrap` is used for basic styling. Will keep on updating changes to this by adding my  `mySQL` db,`docker implementation` and `React integration` with a `GraphQL API`.
